# EduArts Backend (Minimal Scaffold)

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Create `.env` based on `.env.example`
3. Run MongoDB locally or provide a Mongo URI
4. Start server: `npm run dev` (requires nodemon) or `npm start`

This scaffold includes:
- User, Tutor, Booking, Category models
- Basic auth routes (register/login)
- Tutor listing and profile creation
