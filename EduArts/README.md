# EduBridgeX - Tuition Platform (Starter Template)

This archive contains a minimal starter template for a full-stack tuition platform with:
- Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
- Frontend (React) scaffold

Follow README files in /backend and /frontend to run the project locally.

Feel free to expand:
- Add validations, authentication middleware, and secure JWT handling.
- Integrate payment (Razorpay/Stripe), video calls (Jitsi/WebRTC), and file storage (Cloudinary).
- Improve UI with Tailwind or Bootstrap and add routing protections.
